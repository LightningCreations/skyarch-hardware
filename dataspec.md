## Clock

The CPU Clock is controlled by the CLK pin. While the CPU is Active (S0-1=00), the CPU Mirrors the clock signal to the CCLK pin. Otherwise the CCLK pin is low.

## Bus Transfer

(Note: In Table below, BE=1 refers to when the CPU sets it. Other devices setting BE prevents the CPU from performming bus transfers until BE falls low)

| BE | W | IO | SC | CX | Address    | Width | Notes                |
|----|---|----|----|----|------------|-------|----------------------|
| 0  | x | x  | x  | x  | N/A        | N/A   | No transfer occuring |
| 1  | 0 | 0  | 0  | x  | A0-29*4    | 32    | Main Memory Read     |
| 1  | 1 | 0  | 0  | x  | A0-29*4    | 32    | Main Memory Write    |
| 1  | 0 | 0  | 1  | x  | A0-29*4    | 32    | Memory Read (Instruction Fetch) |
| 1  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0  | A0-19      | W0-4  | I/O Port Read |
| 1  | 1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | A0-19      | W0-4  | I/O Port Write |
| 1  | 0 | 1  | 1  | 0  | N0-3:A0-4* | 32    | Coprocessor Register Read |
| 1  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 0  | N0-3:A0-5* | 32    | Coprocessor Register Write |
| 1  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1  | N0-3       | 32    | Coprocessor Register Execute |

All unused bits of A0-29 are set to 0.

(x means Don't Care)

The lower Width bits of the Data bus contain the salient data, other bits are Connected to a Pull Down Resistor.

BE is an IO pin that controls whether or not the Bus is in use. When not set to 1 by the CPU, it is connected to a pull down resistor. 

When BE is not set by the CPU, all other bits are unconnected, except for Data, which is connected to a pull down resistor.

The BA signal is used to indicate when read operations are completed. A bus read is aborted (BA is not set) if EX=1 is set.
Write operations are expected to be received no later than the 4th cycle since BE became High.

Combination not specified above is treated as invalid and are not produced in current versions of the bus.

### Bus Transfer Protocol

The following timing protocol is used for data transfer:
* Cycle 0(RE): CPU sets BE=1,
* Cycle 0(FE): Address lines, Data lines (for writes), W, IO, and SC become available
* Cycle 1(FE): Data and Address, W, IO, and SC lines latched by downstream,
* Cycle 2(RE): Data, IO, and SC lines become unavailable (may not contain salient values),
* Cycle N(RE) (W=0): Downstream sets BA=1
* Cycle N(FE) (W=0): CPU latches Data from downstream.
* Cycle N(FE): Earliest Cycle for CPU to set BE=0.
* Cycle N+1(RE) (W=0, IO=0): CPU May set W=1 to perform a succesive write. If so, downstream releases the Data lines.
* Cycle N+1(FE) (initial W=0, IO=0, W=1): Data lines for successive write are made available.
* Cycle N+2(FE) (init W=0, IO=0, W=1): New Data lines latched by downstream
* Cycle N+k(FE): CPU unsets BE=1,
* Cycle N+k+2(RE): Earliest cycle that CPU will set BE=1 for subsequent bus operation

(N is the number of cycles before downstream sets BA in the case of a read, and is 3 for a write, k is the number of cycles after the earliest point the CPU unsets BE=1)

If, during an initial Memory Read, the CPU performs an immediate write with the same Bus Enable, k is a minimum of 2. Otherwise k is a minimum of 0.

### Coprocessor Transfer Address

Coprocessor registers are identified by A0-4. The Coprocessor to access is identified by N0-1. 

As a special case for Writes, An address of 100000 (A5=1, A0-4=0) accesses the Coprocessor Control Register (visible for Coprocessor N as Map 6, Register N)
A5 is not used for reads, and any other values of A0-4 with A5=1 are invalid.

### LOCK and External BE

The BE pin is IO to allow multiple devices (including coprocessors and other Micron CPUs) to share the same bus for basic operations without complicated coherency logic. While BE is brought high externally, the Micron CPU will not attempt to perform any bus accesses or coprocessor instruction dispatches. Instead, the CPU will wait on them until BE becomes low.

The LOCK pin is a specialized pin for supporting atomic memory accesses. When LOCK is high, the Micron CPU will not attempt to perform any memory accesses, other than instruction fetches. The LOCK pin does not control I/O port accesses or coprocessor register accesses. It also does not block instruction fetches. LOCK is an output pin because it may be used as one in a future chip. Current Micron CPUs do not generate LOCK signals.

### Primitive Read-Modify-Writes

When reading main memory (IO=0, W=0), after BA becomes High, the CPU may set W=1 at the immediately following rising edge (Cycle N+1). If so, it places data to write on the bus at the falling edge of that cycle. 

## Exceptions and IRQs

EX and IRQ allow the processor to respond to external conditions. EX triggers an urgent external condition (NMI or asynchronous exception). IRQ triggers a non-urgent external condition (Interrupt).

An Exception or Interrupt Request occurs by placing a non-zero value on the bus before the rising edge of a clock pulse. It the value must be held until the falling edge. 

Interrupt Requests are only serviced if the IM signal is set to 0. This is controlled by the CPU's i and t flags (i=1 and t=0), and by the CPU status (`S < 3`). In this state, the IRQ signals are not read (but must still be connected).

Additionally, only certain exceptions are serviced when the CPUs t flag is set (indicating that the CPU is handling an exception) or when the CPU status is Stopped.
There is no hardware indication of this flag's status on its own. Non-serviced exceptions are ignored.

The following values are permissible for the EX pin:

* EX=1: Bus Error (Triggers `Ex[2]`). Ignores Trap flag if recieved during Bus Cycle
* EX=7: Non-maskable Interrupt (Triggers `Ex[7]`)
* EX=8-15: Coprocessor Error. Ignores Trap flag if recieved CPU is waiting on Coprocessor EX-8

## Status

| S | Status  | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 0 | Normal  | Running |
| 1 | Waiting | Waiting on Co-processor |
| 2 | Halted  | Stopped by Halt Instruction (Waiting for Interrupt) |
| 3 | Stopped | Stopped by STOP instruction (Waiting for Reset) |

## Reset

Bring RESET High for Minimum of 2 Cycles to trigger a reset. S0-1=11 will indicate when the CPU is no longer busy, RESET brought low any time after this indication will trigger CPU Start up.
The CPU is put into the state described by the ISA Specification. Additionally, S0-1 becomes 0 after at most 2 cycles.

When the CPU Is powered on, the Status will be set to S0-1=11. RESET must be brought high for 2 cycles, then low.
